napier.

    Usage:
        napier compute -p <precision> -t <tasks> -o <output> [-q]
        napier benchmark -p <precision> -t <tasks> -o <output> [-q]
        napier (-h | --help)
        napier --version

    Commands:
        compute                         Performs computation by a given number of summation terms,
                                        maximum number of tasks and output file to dump to.
        benchmark                       For a given fixed precision, runs computation with tasks from 1 to the given
                                        maximum number and dumps csv file with the results.

    Options:
        -h --help                       If present, help is shown.
        --version                       Show version.
        -p --precision <precision>      The number of summation terms in the series approximation.
        -t --tasks <tasks>              The maximum number of tasks
        -o --output <output>            The output file. The result is dumped to this file.
        -q --quiet                      If set to true, does not output information about thread starting and stopping.
